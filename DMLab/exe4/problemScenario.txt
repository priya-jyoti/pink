uniquely from among the products of that company. Each pharmacy has a name, address, and
phone number. Each patient is checked up by some doctor. Every doctor has at least one
patient. Each pharmacy sells several drugs and has a price for each. A drug could be sold at
several pharmacies, and the price could vary from one pharmacy to another. Doctors
prescribe drugs for patients. A doctor could prescribe one or more drugs for several patients,
and a patient could obtain prescriptions from several doctors. Each prescription has a date
and a quantity associated with it. 
Pharmaceutical companies have long-term contracts with
pharmacies. A pharmaceutical company can contract with several pharmacies, and a
pharmacy can contract with several pharmaceutical companies. For each contract, you have
to store a start date, an end date, supervisor and the text of the contract.
